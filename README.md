# __X-CUBE-TCPP Firmware Package__

![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/x-cube-tcpp.svg?color=brightgreen)

## __Description__

**X-CUBE-TCPP** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative. It uses for USB Type-C and Power Delivery software expansion for STM32Cube
([UM2285](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00432311-development-guidelines-for-stm32cube-expansion-packages-stmicroelectronics.pdf)).

**X-CUBE-TCPP** is a USB-IF certified Expansion Package (**USB Type-C Rev 2.0 and Power Delivery 3.1**) and consists of libraries, drivers, sources, APIs and application examples
running on STM32 Series GP microcontrollers embedding Type-C and power delivery management (thanks to the embedded UCPD PHY integrated in STM32G4, STM32G0, STM32L5 and STM32U5).

For the other STM32 GP MCU without embedded UCPD PHY (like STM32L4, STM32F0...), this package demonstrates how to comply with Type-C specification.

All the applications available in this package need to have either the [TCPP01-M12](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp01-m12.html), the [TCPP02-M18](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp02-m18.html) or the [TCPP03-M20](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp03-m20.html) integrated.

The [TCPP01-M12](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp01-m12.html) (Type-C port protection) is a single chip solution for USB Type-C port protection that facilitates the migration from USB legacy connectors type-A or type-B to USB Type-C connectors.

The [TCPP02-M18](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp02-m18.html) (Type-C port protection) is a single chip solution for USB Type-C port protection in the context of Source applications.

The [TCPP03-M20](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp03-m20.html) (Type-C port protection) is a single chip solution for USB Type-C port protection in the context of Dual Role Power applications.

**STMicroelectronics package has been certified by USB-IF through the reference [TID 5205](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/42552), [TID 6408](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/43767), [TID 3036](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/40004), [TID 7884](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/45433) and [TID 8088](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/45710).**
