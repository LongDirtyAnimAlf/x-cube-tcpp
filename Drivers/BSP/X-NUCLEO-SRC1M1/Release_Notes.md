# Purpose

The X-NUCLEO-SRC1M1 is an expansion board for the NUCLEO-G071RB and NUCLEO-G474RE development boards or any STM32 Nucleo development board equipped with a USB Type-C™ peripheral.

[![IMAGE](_htmresc/x-nucleo-src1m1.jpg)](https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-src1m1.html)

It provides a straightforward means for evaluating USB Type-C™ Power Delivery in SRC mode based on TCPP02-M18.
The USB Type-C connector can supply the STM32 Nucleo development board thanks to a 3.3 V LDO.
